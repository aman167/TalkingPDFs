# TalkingPDFs
This project uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant information from PDFs. Users can upload PDFs, submit queries, and get accurate responses based on the document content. It combines a retriever model and generative model for intelligent, real-time query handling.

# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) PDF Query System

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to efficiently extract and retrieve relevant information from PDF documents. The system allows users to upload PDFs, submit a query, and retrieve specific answers from the provided documents. This project is particularly useful for document-heavy fields where fast and accurate information retrieval is critical.

## Features:
- **PDF Input**: Upload and process multiple PDF files as the data source.
- **Query-based Search**: Accepts user queries and extracts the most relevant information from the PDFs.
- **RAG Model**: Combines the power of a retriever model to find relevant passages and a generative model to answer user queries based on the retrieved content.
- **Seamless Interaction**: The pipeline provides real-time interaction with the user, similar to a chatbot.

## Technologies Used:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Python
- PDF processing libraries
- NLP libraries for text retrieval and generation
- Integration with machine learning models for intelligent search and query response

## Future Work:
- Extend the project with more complex NLP techniques
- Add support for additional document types (e.g., DOCX)
- Optimize model performance for large-scale documents
