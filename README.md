# TalkingPDFs
Hereâ€™s a concise version of the description:  ---  This project uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant information from PDFs. Users can upload PDFs, submit queries, and get accurate responses based on the document content. It combines a retriever model and generative model for intelligent, real-time query handling.
